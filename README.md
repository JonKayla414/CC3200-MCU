# CC3200-MCU
Portfolio Submission for Embedded Systems


-The UART Project was designed to implement a state machine. A user can Connect to the serial port and toggle the LED on or off by typing the command.

- The GPIO project uses a state machine to send morse code with the lights for OK and SOS. A user can press the button to change the state of themachine. 
I think I implemented the state machine well and I could improve on the timing function. 
Some Skills that I learend include using the call back funtions for the timer and GPIOinterrupt. 
This project is readable beacuse it uses C coding standards and practices.
